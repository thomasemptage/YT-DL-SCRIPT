# YT-DL-SCRIPT
Script for yt-dlp
A very simple script i use to run YT-DLP in a directory, to download a channels videos to the current directory.

The channels URL needs to be entered into a file "input.txt" in the same location as the script.

Improvements for the future..

I would like it to iterate over multiple directories rather than copying the script to each one.
