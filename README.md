# YT-DL-SCRIPT

A very simple script I use to run YT-DLP, also implementing a notifaction via Telegram when it has finished. 

Prerequisites.
- YT-DLP ( And FFMPEG if you plan on re-encoding videos etc)
- Curl - Used to send a request to telegram. Could be done with wget etc. 

Instructions
Clone the repo to a directory on your machine and enter a list of videos or channels into the input.txt file.
